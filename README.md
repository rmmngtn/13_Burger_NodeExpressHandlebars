# Burger Log Node-Express-Handlebars


## Description
​This application connects the front end to the backend, using a mySQL database, express, node, and handlebars in order to categorize burgers that have been eaten and burgers that have yet to be eaten. Users can even create their own burgers, and save them to the database to either be devoured or listed to try again.
